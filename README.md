# My-first-PyGame
Simple game where you dodge blocks. As you dodge them you increase your score. The blocks fall faster as your score increases.
Need to fix the collision issue. Player can only collide with the first block but goes through the other 9. 
Need to create a boundary so the player cannot go outside of the screen.
