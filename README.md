# My-first-PyGame
Created a game with Sublime Text and Python where you dodge falling blocks to increase your score. The blocks fall faster as your score increases. Use the directional arrows on the keyboard to move your block up down left and right to dodge the falling blocks.

Need to create a function for multiple collision detections. 
Need to create a boundary so the player cannot go outside of the screen.

What I learned:
I learned how to: use PyGame, make collision detection functions for two objects, create a window screen, create a loop to keep the window open until the game is over, spawn multiple enemies with a loop, update the position of the blocks to create movement, increase difficulty with if and else statements, why using a constant is better than magic numbers, change screen, player and enemy colors with RGB wheel, add text to the screen to display a score board for the player, end the game when the player collides with another block.
