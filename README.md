Simple block game where the player must avoid falling blocks to increase their score. As their score increases so does the speed at which the blocks fall. Use the up, down, left, right arrow keys to move.

Improvements to be made: tbd


What i learned from this project:

Create a game window with vertical grid lines to simulate lanes for the player.

Create falling blocks for the player to dodge. As each block disappears off the screen they reappear at the top of the screen.

Randomly drop each block from a specific spawn point by filling a list and having the computer randomly select from that list.

Allow the Player to control their block and move it up, down, left and right.

Increase difficulty as the player’s score increases.

Created my own collision detection function instead of using PyGame’s built in function.

How to create a ceiling, floor and teleporting sides like in Pac Man.
