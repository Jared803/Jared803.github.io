Simple block game where blocks fall from the sky and the player must avoid them. As you dodge the blocks your score increases and as the score increases so does the difficulty. Use the arrow keys to move left, right, up and down.

Improvements to be made: 
I want to add a feature that allows the player to move to the far left and appear at the far right and vice versa like in Pacman. 
Add a boundry wall where the lanes end.

From this project I learned how to:

Create a game window with vertical grid lines to simulate lanes for the player.

Create falling blocks for the player to dodge. As each block disappears off the screen they reappear at the top of the screen.

Randomly drop each block from a specific spawn point by filling a list and having the computer randomly select from that list.

Allow the Player to control their block and move it up, down, left and right.

Increase difficulty as the player’s score increases.

Created my own collision detection function instead of using PyGame’s built in function.
